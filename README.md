# Music Releases
This was a first project to practice React and pair programming.
The task was to build a page with new music releases. Displaying the different albums and links using data from an API and designing components in React. 

## The problem
The main problem was getting used to thinking in React, but with practice we managed that. 
We used the liveshare in VS and worked through it together.
